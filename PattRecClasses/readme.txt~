Inorder to Run Assignment 1:

Run the sunning.m script with following changes:
1) for task 2 : Use mc2 and singlevariate Gaussian with T=10000
   mean(S==1)
   mean(S==2)
 run above 2 commands to get frequency of states
2) for task 3: Use mc2 and singlevariate Gaussian with T=10000
   E[X] = mean(X(:,1)) 
   var[X] = var(X(:,1))
  Similarly for second state
3) for task4 : input T= 500 , use mc2 and singlevariate Gaussian
  plot(X) to get the plot
4) for task5 : input T=500 , use mc2 with both the means = 0 and 
  singlevariate Gaussian.
  plot(X) to get the plot
5)for task6 : use mc and singlevariate Gaussian
6)for task7 : use mc and multivariate Gaussian

The code also works for Discrete values instead of Gaussian.
